## Styled Components

Styled Components is a CSS-in-JS library. For more info on its usage, check out the [official documentation](https://styled-components.com/docs). The `styled-components` extension wraps your Next.js app in a styled components ThemeProvider and adds the `ServerStyleSheet` to the `Document` component for generating styled-components styles on the server side.
