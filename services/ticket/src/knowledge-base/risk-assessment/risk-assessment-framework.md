# Risk Assessment Framework

The DEP risk assessment framework helps identify, evaluate, and mitigate potential risks associated with data initiatives.

## Risk Assessment Process

1. **Risk Identification**: Identify potential risks across various categories (privacy, security, compliance, etc.).
2. **Inherent Risk Assessment**: Evaluate the level of risk without any controls in place.
3. **Control Identification**: Identify existing controls that mitigate the identified risks.
4. **Residual Risk Assessment**: Evaluate the level of risk after considering existing controls.
5. **Risk Response**: Determine how to address residual risks (accept, mitigate, avoid, transfer).
6. **Task Creation**: Create tasks to implement additional controls for risks that need mitigation.

## Risk Categories

- **Privacy Risks**: Risks related to personal information handling.
- **Security Risks**: Risks related to data security and protection.
- **Compliance Risks**: Risks related to regulatory compliance.
- **Operational Risks**: Risks related to business operations.
- **Reputational Risks**: Risks that could impact TELUS's reputation.
